0,This headphone is good but not that much as i expected*Pros- 1Good battery backup             2Good sound quality*Cons-1 There's a voice gap between video activity and voice. Voice comes after video activity not both comes together. It is ok when you watch movies and music but if you play pubg with it you will clearly feel the big gap it matters a lot for me. It is not working after 4 month very much disappointedOverall not goodDon't buy please,0

170,In this product there is the vibration issuewhich will make you irritate and there is no solution for it. It is the inbuilt feature of this product.

1370,zero bass. not worth the price ..better headphones for half the price like Flipkarts very own .build quality is ok .. headphones fits good in Ur ears .but important is sound quality which it lacks,0
1371,Just like any another earphones. Bass is not that special as said. Bass is normal like you get in any other normal earphone. It was a disspointment as they said this is a bass special.  Now only thing that will determine if these are good is the time. If they survived for 1 year without any fault then I will say they are good otherwise they are bad cause there is nothing special in this earphone.,0

But this doesn't have much anything to be worth recommending for. The sound volume is low, it lacks clarity at the highest volume it can afford and even at lowest levels it doesn't have much of clarity let alone bass. I would rather buy the home-owned brand of its competitive leader in e-shopping, which i got just for 50 when it was launched. Till now, i haven't...",0
1377,Bassheads?? I don't think so. Loud but voice ia not clear at full sound or bass heavey. You can buy it for its great mic. Crystal ckear. If you talk too much on phine this is the one. Reviewed on my youtube channel Traveltech FUN make you decesion as per your preference. Not for bass heavy music but for long clear chats.,0
1378,"If you are opting it for heavy bass, please don't buy a it don't have any. Very basic level of bass only. Design and build quality is superb as well sound quality which is some what better. But for me I love bass and I don't get it.",0
1379,along with this i ordered boult storm...its quality is far better than this...the wire quality is not that good and often tangles are formed...sound precison and quality is not good.. if u get boult at the same price go for it ...dont just rely on the brand name ...i assure that boult is far better than boat,0
1380,This head phone is not good enough. The sound quality is not good. Vocals are good but bass and other instrumental sounds are bad. I expect much better head phone from boat. The wire quality is also not good. I think Boat should improve their headphone quality in aspect of sound and wire too. Thank you. :-(,0
1381,"This is not good product , I was also using previous ear phone that was too good but this ear phone wire is very thin , this is bad in quality only in wire by the way sound quality is good and base quality is also very good",0

1387,These are the best budget friendly earphone in this segment the sound is not extremely good but good considering the price and obviously the one year warranty from boat is the best partüëç,0
1388,i ordered it 2mnth ago.  but today the right side of the earpiece is not working i dont know why. its been 2 mnth only.   6 mnths back i ordered a jbl earpiece for rs800 it was also not working  the right side of the earpiece.  i used tht for 1mnth nearly.   for keeping it in good condition i purchased a pouch also so that it lasts longer but i dnt knw after taking a proper care of it how it stops working.  very dissapointed,0
1389,"Sound quality is not as expected. Although sound is crisp and clear but it do not have bass. I have seen reviews of this but these r not good as they were talking. And yes I m a musician so i know about sounds. I use equaliser to boost the bass and after this it work just fine. If u can't pay a penny more buy this one and if u can spend 100 more go for JBL which r way better than this, I've tries that too that's why i m saying",0

It does not have punchy beats, voice is more evident and background instruments are some what feel artificial and beats feel artificial too very artificial ear phones. I personally prefer natural beats and instrument sound to feel the same energy as the composers and singers experienced. I did not like it, very artificial.",0
1393,If you are looking a stylish earphones than this product is made for you. It's bass quality isn't so good but when you listen at a low volume you will get a  good quality sound & lilttle bit of bass which is just fair to the price that you pay. But when you talk about the packaging it's impressive they deliver to you with a very safety processe that what is needed.,0
1394,Is works like normal earphones. No extra bass quality in it. Ik it has warranty but still 4 months me kharab hua .. like seriously man? I have to contact customer care. Not good for music lovers at all. Must check all reviews before buying.,0
1395,let me try to be objectivethey are normal earphones with mic.no way to identify left and right quickly and the marking is too small to fund. the plugs fit in but are not comfortablethe bass is just horrible.voice clarity is good.not worth the price. thought boAt was making good qaulity. I haven't tried their higher prices ones but this does not make sense,0

1405,"For the first time, I am posting a review, just because the product compelled me to do so. Icouldn't find a single aspect missed or mis-handled by Boat. Well this is called, quality engineering.

1412,"Good product. Never used bluetooth headset before. Now I am happy to see ease in my work. As I noticed boat marketing their products aggressively in market in recent days. About product it's like awesome having better build quality, bass is good, battery backup is fine and vibration though it vibrates my neck when ever I gets call but still feature is must needed when u are driving.

1485,Although it's too early to write a review after just one day of use but I was using skullcandy method for two years but due to support local manufacturer this time I decided to purchase these earphones and believe me it's way more better than any other so called established brands.

1535,"Better than expected! Great Indian product, very clear and bass is super. Due to high bass, peak volume makes more sound which can't be avoided in this type of earphones. Long quality cables. It's slipping from ear as it has more weight in outside, it's required for high bass earphones. That's the reason, ear hook is given along. Buttons and mic is good.",1

1670,So I have been using these for about a month now. The battery backup is good which usually lasts 8 to 9 hours. But you can't actually use once it reaches 20 percent. It starts annoying you with 'battery low' message every 20 seconds or so. They could have set the annoying threshold to 5 percent. And driving on 2 wheelers with these is a nightmare. It flies away if you drive fast even while not using it with the magnetic earbuds connected. Sound and bass is good considering its price (899)The...,1

A treble note is seems more enhanced which might be be annoying during prolonged use.Fir those who confused between Realme Buds and One plus Wireless Z If you want a balanced clear sound without much bass and Long battery back up( *around 18 hrs) go for Wireless.

But the only thing which I wish could've been better is the latency. It's almost 1 sec after which the sound is heard(some times it's less than a sec). Other than that, it's other features such is the magnetic on-off function works fabulously.

2273,"After using it fron last 2 weeks, now I can say that is it one of the best.Sound quality is great and works awesome during calls.Best feature is having magnetic buds. They are easy to carry and once you attach both buds magnetically, it immediately turns off. During calls, it takes 1-2 seconds to connect automatically as soon as I detach both ear buds.",1

2279,Overall a good quality earphones with awesome sound...lag while watching movies and other YouTube videos is minimal and you can't notice it...but there is a lag of about 1 sec while playing games..build quality is also great...connection is good and it lasts for 8-10 meters...battery backup is nice with average of 10-12 hrs,1
2280,Earphones have performed as per expectations after a months usage. The auto switch off after connecting earphone pods is one of the best and unique feature. Battery backup is not up to the mark but very well lasts throughout a normal 10 hr work day. The middle button for receiving calls could have been designed better. Not ideal for gaming as lag of 1-2 secs is seen.,1
2281,"A very good product with little higher price. Happy with the product sound and battery backup runtime. I have charged only once in last 10 days and I am using  everyday at least one hour to 2 hours. The wire length from speaker to neckband is very short, less than 6inch. I was expecting longer length as shown in product advertisment. overall a good experience",1

Fast 6 seconds zero touch pairing.*If you want to operate 1 or more devices with this without any hassle spend ‚Çπ200 more and buy a ONEPLUS BULLETS WIRELESS Z*Definitely not for *PUBG* playersBest thing that they are tuned by ALAN WALKER so if you are an EDM fan just go for it,1

2343,So I have been using this headset for about 3 months now.I have purchased them mainly for workout. Even after being in contact with sweat for hours they work pretty well. Sound quality is fine not very good. In this range these buds are among the best. Battery life is pretty good and here it beats most of its competition.Easy pairing and magnetic off/on is a delight.,1

2364,Best quality. SOUND is very clear and bass is awesome but battery backup is quite less than 12 hours. All over best product far better than boat rokerzz,1
2365,"Best sound quality ever heard from a Bluetooth earphone ,bass is incredibly good ,its not like other earphones which gives massive grr sound as bass this earphone gives the real bass",1
2366,Good battery packeup... Really like it... Good bass.... Love it,1
2367,"11.2mm bass boost but bass is less than boat rokerz, other wise it's really amazing battery life good design",1
2368,"I have used many earphones but this is one of the best.  It's got amazing bass and the best feature is the auto switch off and on feature. when the earphones are joined together,  the earphones turn off and when they are separated,  the turn on.  This results in long battery life.  The only drawback is the call answer button.  It is not in the best position and you need to get used to it to answer any call quickly.",1
2369,1st of all this this is new company in India so I was worried and little bit careful before buying this .. But after seeing lots of videos and reviews on YouTube I bought this..And after using this for 2 weeks I can say this is just amazing when we talk about build quality and battery backup... I just loved itThis is best air buds at this price range... Just go for it,1
2370,Need to improve Button position and response with sound or beep... Music control ... Ow awesome quality.. Better comfortability... Better Bass... All is good in this price....,1
2371,"Look wise loved it, overall good product , delivered in time.. Purchased 1 week ago working good...",1
2372,amazing bass with clear sound quality .. and convenient to use with magnetic ends that enables the switching on anf off of Bluetooth....battery life is ok,1
2373,Backup is very goodSound quality is very goodBass is not that refined but okay.Call quality is decent but battery drains faster while using at the time of calls.Rest all is very good at the price point.,1
2374,I have Boat 255 Wireless also at home which my wife uses..So I will do a comparison between Realme Wireless and Boat Wireless 255Bass-                   Boat is more bass heavy and Realme is balanced sound. if you like bass heavy go for BoatLength of wire - Boat is 5-6 Cm longer wires. That difference is noticeable when you turn neck to sides. Maybe important to some people.Battery and usable hours - Realme wins this because of Magnetic on off functionality. Boat is max 6 hours. Realm...,1
2375,I am using it since one month and my reviews arePros:1. Best Form Factor2. Light Weight3. Amazing Sound Quality4. Outstanding battery backup.5. Effortless Connectivity.Cons:Bass could be better.Overall most reliable and effective product delivered by Realme.,1
2376,"Worth of every penny spent....! 1. Battery backup is not less than 11hrs in any situation2. Bass is awesom if i compare this to giants like Boat, sony etc.3. Comfortable adjustment and best quality materials for neck design.4. Colour combination is also good but i would have preferred black wire instead of yellow in my model.",1
2377,Nice earphones. Very good bass. The only con about this is it doesnt work well for calls. The person we are talking can hear our background sounds more than our own voice.,1
2378,Awesome headset. Great sound and battery quality. But can be better in longer distance connectivity. Still it manages well,1
2379,I am very satisfied üòä with these earphones and I must say the sound quality is awesome & the quality of the product is excellent... I will recommend this to everyone... Guys go for it without hesitation.... You will not regret after buying these earphones ! ***** & Lastly Flipkart thanks for delivering my order before time !,1
2380,The sound quality is so real that realme proved they nailed the market.thers are best wireless earphones under 3000.The bass is perfect the treble is perfect and connectivity is good with 12 hr + battery backup,1
2381,a super product...it is absolutely a thriller...bt design should be update...neck band design is very soft and good.bt wire is not in proper postion more hanging was there..position of wire should changed,1
2382,Awesome super best Master blast made for brands Don't think about money just enjoy qulity,1
2383,"In first impressions you'll feel little bit less bass and low volume. But after 2-3 days you'll get use to it even max volume feels like more tha enough. And the best feature is that magnetic control, it instantly gets off and on and saves lot more battery.",1
2384,"Definitely better than many others out in the market. The magnetic on/off technology is simply awesome and the time it takes to connect is easy. Awesome sound and bass, with great high and mid tones. Great clarity of call. No volume problems. Latency still exists for games. Nothing to do there. But overall, it is worth buying.",1
2385,Nice purchase and not so much good in sound quality. Its decent and balanced sound.voice over phone calls are not petty  clear,1
2386,The best bluetooth neckband earphones I hve never seen .. The sound and bass is too good.. Coming to the battery back the battery back up is awesome and it lasts for 10 hrs. I'm so satisfied with this product.,1
2387,The most amazing earphone by realme at this budget with best bass & clear voice call. Battery backup is just amazing.

2391,Build quality is awesome at this price range Battery backup is excellent Not highly appreciated for bass heads Worth for the price and go for it,1
2392,"I brought this because i have a realme phone and it has very good battery backup. There's some minor things that i dont like (it doesn't vibrates when someone calls you, you can connect only one device at a time, don't have protection on the charging port, balanced bass, doesn't had extra bass like boat headphones) but other than that it's the best nickband. Battery backup is just awesome plus it has very good charging speed. It doesn't hurt your ears. It's very comfortable to wear.",1
2393,"I'm overall impressed with this product...It's been almost 22 days I'm using this product...Overall no complain..But still there is something u should know....PROS:- * Sound quality is above expectations *Build quality is too good*Best thing of this earphone is it's battery backup..

2396,"I am happy with the product. Sound quality is awesome, no harm for eardrums at all as much as I have used. Sound lagging with games like PUBG. Battery back up is great. Upgradation can be sone on bass quality to make music feel to the core. Over all a thumbs up. 4.5/5, 0.5 can be earned on improved bass quality. Thank you!Happy as it is worth.",1
2397,"Brilliant headset. Will always stick like a magnet whenever you remove them from your ears. It helps saving battery by stoping music. It's quite convenient and tidy. The levels are good, especially high bit rate songs. Good buy üëç",1

2400,"Bass is more than good. Sound quality is awesome. Comfort level is great don't feel anything hazzy. Fits to ear very well. Build Quality is good only thing I disliked that there's no protection for charging spot sweat or water can damage & call alert vibration while incoming call you must have provided it when build everything good apart from it. Magnetic on off is great way to fuction, saves a lot of battery. 2 more button if given on the left side for operating would have made operating it ...",1
2401,Earphones are really good and have a very good battery backup. Bass is really good Sound quality is clear If you seeing forward to buy it don't bother it will stand your requirements obviously.,1
2402,After using buds more than one month I m going to write my review.. sound pattern of dynamic drivers 11.5mm with base is awesome but not with twitters sound(like jhan jhan sound)  bettery back is very good comparatively to JBL. But one thing I note that is calling feature.. it‚Äôs worst. The mike of buds pick a lot of sound from background than my voice. Even blowing air sound heard too much to listener.,1
2403,"Best wireless ear phone it is ...Bass is good , design is good and build quality is good",1
2404,"Best in this price range. Awesome sound quality and bass is also good as per the  price. Build quality awesome. Battery backup insane.... 10-12 hours and supports fast charging too, full charge in 1.5 hrs.",1
2405,Overall experience is good but while playing PUBG the synchronization is not good when i fire from gun the sound of bullet came late around 0.05 to 1 sec so it was so irritating for me.. i would recommend this product for calling and listening music but not recommend for playing games specially PUBG,1
2406,very good product from ream me. the most amazing thing is its magnetic effect. voice quality is best and also battery back up is best. go through it. paisa vasool headphone hai bhai.,1
2407,Actually i purchased it after watching so much comparison videos on youtube and finally i got the best one. The sound quality is awesome.Battery backup is also 5/5.Design is also 5/5.Bass is average but you will love that punchy sound.It's the best product on this range.,1
2408,"These have excellent build quality, great battery backup, fantastic call experience (thanks to its mics). Sound quality is not top notch although bass heads will love it. Definitely not for those who are looking for the balance sound and punchy but non over powering bass. These support SBC and AAC codecs in all those android phones which have android Oreo and above. If you get this for 1499 or 1599 or anything lower then these are excellent value for money.",1
2409,"The vocals are perfect clear.But in the case of bass we need to compromise a bit.Built quality is good but black colour will be better than yellow and give these buds a standard look.I bought this product n 24th feb 20,so after a detailed use i wil update about  the battery backup.Overall at this range, i suggest realme buds rather than anyother.Thankyou realme for this product.",1

2413,Over a bang for the buck. Best wireless earphone available at this price segment. Bass is phenomenal and overall build quality is great. Battery backup is decent too. Getting 8-10 hours of playback time.,1
2414,"It's really awesome. Sound is perfect I am the person who use earphones at 100 volume but in this I use 60-70% is max for me although 100 volume on this is superb. Design quality is awesome and the magnet feature is handy, also battery backup is great‚ô•Ô∏è Loved it",1

2419,"I have tried many products from boats to NuRepublic. I can suggest Proudly that realme is the best for anyone looking for good sound quality, with great battery backup and most importantly the calls. Call quality is decent in outdoors, you are required to put mic closer to your mouth in traffic, where as in home it is unbeatable at this price.Battery backup is one of the USP of this product.",1
2420,Great sound you Love it if you like to listen old song of 90s and decent enough bass for bass boosted songs.,1
2421,"These earphones are fantastic. The best feature that it has and it distinguishes it from other earphones of this range is the feature that it automatically turns off when you join the earbuds. Trust me, this is a really useful feature which is not present in Boat and JBL earphones of similar range. For this reason I was ready to pay some extra bucks for it. There is just one negative. Bass is not good enough. If you're looking for earphones wherein bass is your priority, these are not for you...",1
2422,"Well just purchased these earbuds,what I have noticed so far is depicted below in Pros& consPros:-Pricing- In this price range you are not going to get anything like thisBuild- Looking at the price point it is quite decent,silicon used is of good class.Bass-The power of these earphones lies here,having 11mm driver produces rich bass.Treble-Here this earphone lacks,treble should be well optimized here.Till this point I have not noticed any distortion which can be really disturbing,there...",1

2426,Writing this after 10 days of use. Sound quality is quite good and played CALL OF DUTY while using this no sound lag found. Battery backup is like 11 hours and bought this for 1600. So it was awesome deal! Build quality is very good yet i think some short of cover has to be provided on charging port for Better protection!,1

2434,"Without any doubt Just go for it.  I have used boat 275v2 (274v2 actually) and used this also. Realme is far ahead from boat in all aspect. Battery life 2 days in normal uses while in boat it just 5-6 hour at same uses.connectivity and call mic voice quality is much better in realme. its too easy to connect to paired device and switch another devices while for boat its 22 much tough job to switch devices. OVERALL Around 4000 INR headset ,no one can beat real me.",1

Still, definitely best in this price range, infact it's better than boat ones. I'll rate 9 on 10 for sound quality. 9.5 for build quality , 9.75 for connectivity , 10 for battery . It's a no brainer at this price , just go for it blindly",1

This earphone has a balanced audio signature.. highs and mids are crystal clear, they dont muffle on full volume. Lows are punchy rather than boomy.

2489,vocals are too good in this price..bass is avarage..i love bass boosted sounds in my ear..but the bass is balanced on this one..but one thing that I don't like but it's the common problem with this range of wireless headphones is there is a delay in sound in pubg mobile like games..but there is no delay in the audio of any kind of  video.. battery is the key of choice here..,1

It has super sound quality with extra thumb bass....

Am writing this long review because i loved this product.... the o...",1
2492,Excellent product. I love this. Excellent sound clarity and Bass.,1
2493,The built quality is super and functions is perfect but the bass is very low if your are try to  buy think use from  someone used because the bass is very low and in movies time dont get the sound effects perfectly,1

2505,"I would rather segregate the review into two different parts. 1. Pros - Built quality is amazing, material used for both, the band & the wire is too good. The keys are also well desgined, you feel it as soft keys. Also the sound quality is amazing. Bass is just thumping. You won't get better sound than this at least in this budget. 2. Cons - Biggest blow i feel is the noise cancellation followed by battery back up. There is no noise cancellation, there is no physical mic too. In  fact when yo...",1
2506,The product is good but if you are fan of bass then you will be dissatisfied. Build quality is good and feels good to use. Battery has been good so far. Overall a good purchase till now,1
2507,Sound is good for the price range they are offering but bass is very average & at higher volume sound clarity gets very average & irritating.Overall Performance is Good,1
2508,This is overall a good product.. Review Battery is average ... you can use it for 6-7 hours max sound quality is good Connectivity is also good ..,1
2509,Sounds are pretty nice but one issue with the wire of earphones that it is little big from thr neck to ear  and there is also no any option to adjust that wire so it hurts me little.. by the way you can get with boult curve wireless becouse sound qualify is just same as this realme only realme has enough price than boult cure you can get in 1399 only,1
2510,"Very nice products with beautiful design and good battery backup,, support on every phone",1
2511,This realme buds are of very good quality and it looks very premium. Its sound and built quality is also very good but one thing I am not satisfied with is that the bass is not that  much as it was written in specification. Otherwise everything is ok.,1

2517,"1000 times better than boat rockerz 225f . Bass and music volume is really good as compared to others. design, features and battery backup is also very good. Best part is magnetic on off functionality. really happy with my purchase.",1
2518,sometimes we think that bass wasn't great but in fact it provide great sound quality and also with good higs as well as lows and the good bass also I m using it with oneplus 7 and i never disappointed with sound quality only one thing was annoying i.e. the colour combinations of black yellow and it's not provide good looks,1
2519,"bass is there.. but on the lighter side.. I preferred the audio quality over the over powering bass but the only thing that threw me off is the latency ,, while watching videos .. there is neglechable difference.. but while playing pubg and codm ..there is a noticable difference.. over all this a nice BT headphones .. realme is doing good on the sound department.. but could've done better in latency",1

2533,The earphones are very nice. Sound quality is good only when both buds are plugged in ear. Noise cancellation is excellant. I am using this earphone in Gym where external music is very loud. But it cancels 90% of the sound. You will not hear what other people are saying. Do not use it while walking roadside or while driving. But sometimes it shows voice lag while playing PUBG. The build quality is sturdy. OVERALL it's a really nice pair of earphones. I would definetly recommend it to all. I a...,1

The highlight of these earphones is the phenomenal battery backup of about 10hrs(at 60-80% volume). Although it comes with Bluetooth 5.0 it doesn't support aptX and uses the lower quality AAC codec. The neckband is comfortable even after prolonged use. Overall a good product.",1

2653,Product is good. But the only issue I can see is that sound and call receiving buttons are on the same button ( 3 different locations ). So when a call comes it is very difficult to feel which button you are pressing. Because of this it is very difficult to receive calls while you are walking. If they would have made 3 different buttons that would have been better. Mostly I have to receive calls through phone only.,1

2776,"Build quality is good - the wires are thicker than regular and button areas are of aluminium construction. Bass and the clarity of sound is remarkable. Only downside is the medium capacity battery, which holds  backup for 2 days of heavy usage, and absence of ip67 certification. You will have to save it from sweat. But cant really complain after getting it at a lower price compared to others. Overall a cool product. I will definitely recommend!",1

It's true that it gives 20 hours battery life on charging for just 30 minutes. Casual users like myself only need to charge it once every 3 days.

Battery, Lasts more than 14 hrs with moderate uses and about 10 hrs with continuous listening music. I'm quite happy with this headset. Only one thing which I didn't like about it it's magnet.

3224,"5 star for flipkart delivery .Sound and build quality is pretty good but can't claim same for the bass.one more thing m not satisfied with comfort level ,most of the time it feels like they are falling .I will update my review after some month",1
3225,"Design and build quality are good. Battery is awesome. Fast charging is also good. Not good for high bass lovers, because of low bass. Soft music lovers can buy. For calling purpose, it is best.",1
3226,Too good i am soo happy its a such a good product  thank you one plus and Flipkart,1
3227,"I'm using this from last 12 days And I really ? love this. Because of its sound quality. I would say that sounds of this Bluetooth is best in this price segment. Bass is also good and i feel the clarity in the bass. When i saw the review every one says that bass low, but when i use this i can say that everyone telling lies and battry backup is awesome. It's rubber band is very handy because i can put it in my pocket very easily without getting any damages. I would say just go for it.",1
3228,Such  beautiful headphones...if you are not that used to listening music and use this for work this 1 is just beyond perfect....truely amazing ...,1
3229,They have the best features and the best battery backup in thisclass nd just buy them if you can compromise with the bass and want a good battery backup,1

3231,Amazing battery backup coupled with decent build quality. Though the sound quality especially the bass leaves a lot to be desired. Even while watching stuff on Netflix i felt that the volume level and output is not up to the mark. The ability to pair with two devices and switching between them on the fly works like a charm and is a great feature. The pause/play by connecting / disconnecting the magnetic earpieces is also a fairly convenient feature to have. Do note that if you're a bass-hea...,1
3232,Just got this headset about 1 week ago. It's awesome. Battery backup is excellent. If you use the headset just for listening to music it will easily play for good 10-12 hrs non stop. Charging is awesome as well - full charge in 10min. Love the product.,1
3233,"Really Excellent.This is my first ever OnePlus product and my experience is really amazing. I am writing this review after 10 days of its use.....though i am not a thumping bass lover, still the bass is sufficient in this device....no issues at all...but if you are a hard core bass lover and a freak only of bass, then this is not for you bro.....i am totally satisfied with its overall sound output, the vocal and instruments are quite prominent and clearer. And loudness is enough. You will de...",1
3234,Amazing Battery Backup lasting upto 4-5 with normal usage.Definitely worth the price.Bass quality is good for the price plus Quick Switch between devices is such handy feature.Fit and finish and rubber neckband feels premium.Best Bluetooth Handsfree Under 2000.,1
3235,"I'm using this for around 3 weeks.. I'm fully satisfied with my purchase.. excellent sound quality , massive battery compared to some other Bluetooth headsets.. neat design. go for this.. definitely a value for money",1
3236,"Mind blowing product , great sound quality, bass is not to heavy but not that much lower , vocals are clear , i have used for almost about 4 hrs continuously so comfort level is also very good",1
3237,"No doubt these are the best earphones in this price range sound quality is better than most,bass could've 10% better but trust me sound quality is the best... although equilizer helps alot... overall these are genuinely good",1
3238,This is one of a terrific product in market for one plus usersüòçüòç . Those who say this doest have good bass just try these headsets on a one plus device you will feel what the real bass which this product gives‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è. Battery backup which none of the device in this price segment can provide or have offered till date. I can easily use this device for a 22 hrs.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,1
3239,Battery back is amazing and sound quality is good. I don't like bass so it's a great product for me. Guys you can purchase this item without hesitation.,1
3240,Unparalleled Battey Backup . Very Low Latency while playing games like PUBG. Overall music is pretty balanced. Must buy. Realme Buds Wireless has better build quality. But OnePlus just beats it in battery backup and features.,1
3241,The build could have been better. At least the wires coming out of the main frame should have been more robust. Battery is awesome as advertised. Very light weight. Also neck band should have been a little more rigid. Sound is okay. Works for me and very good for calls. Unless you're a die hard music buff who wants crystal clear audio on every beat... This is the headphone for you.,1
3242,one of the best earphones ever bought. premium build quality with exquisite look. Bass could be a thing to be worked on. Rest everything is fine.,1
3243,"It's awesome headset guys. I'm been using this two weeks and amazing battery backup and awesome sound. For those who are saying it has no bass that is completely wrong. It includes decent bass, i think you are not experiencing bass becz of earbud. I just replace one plus earbud with my sennheiser small earbud.. Guys you must try the differents.. Bass is just boosted and i cant believe it..Must by budget Bluetooth headset with incredible battery backup.",1
3244,Very delighted to use these headsets. Most useful for corporate use. Works for me.. Thank you üôÇ,1
3245,Talking about the pros:1.Build quality is nice and superior in this price range. 2. Battery backup is excellent. 3. Got c port charger which charges very quickly. Cons: 1. For bass lovers this is not the product for u. 2. Mic quality is decent not that great as compared to the other products.,1
3246,The sound quality is very good and balanced. Battery backup is as per claimed. In a word its a great bluetooth earphones and great deal in 2k price range.,1
3247,Very good earphone by one plus in this range.  Bass level iss moderate not too good but every thing is too good,1
3248,Very well balanced and good connectivity support alongwith immense battery life...,1
3249,Apart is bass everything is great. Bass is just good not that great. Best quality I liked that you can actually switch between your devices with a double click button on your headset. Go for it.,1
3250,From the time I got this to till now after using more than 6 hours I can say that it is performing very well. Good product but the thin cable used for headphone buds are not so impressive at all. I have still doubt about their durability. Though most of the time it remains out of the stock for its high demand on Flipcart. Finally I got this. Delivery is early before the date. Oneplus box pakaging is very very good but pakaging from flipcart is avarage. Thank god it got no damage. Afterall thi...,1
3251,Excellent product. Better than expected. Best buy in this price range and best in the segment. Good work oneplus.,1
3252,Bass is enough but sound quality would be little more clear.. For good quality of bass use bass booster app.. It will help you to produce a good quality of bass.. And enjoy,1
3253,"Battery backup is amazing, easily running for more than 10-20 hrs.Sound quality is too good, i don't know why some people say bass is not good.. Amazing sound..Its great deal in this using for work outs.. keeping my phone in ground floor, connectivity to 1st floor is seamless..Go for it, quality headset.",1
3254,The design is neat. The sound quality is good and the vocals are really good.However if you are a gamer then I'd not recommend this due to latency.I mean it's really bad. Atleast a delay of 1sec and that really mattera if you are a Pro player.The low patency mode is only available for the Oneplus devices only.,1
3255,Most advanced and budget earphones are here!!If you need best bass and sound wid avg charging time then go for realme buds @1800.If you need best avg bass and sound wid quick charging time then go for thisüíØüíØ,1
3256,It's actually deserve 4 star because of less bass.But according to price we can manage it.So it's a 5 star product.It's good that you get enough features and very good sound quality but best feature is10 minute charge & you will get more than 9 hour battery backup and another is you can switch the connection from mobile to laptop or any other device easily and it is automatically connected.,1
3257,"Overall it has got very balanced sound signature. Bass is there but little low. Not an ideal product for bassheads.Very good for listening acoustic music.Very lightweight, build quality is very nice. Even after using it for long time no problems like pain in ear observed.Switching between works flawlessly, it just takes 1 sec. Call quality from mic is pretty good.",1
3258,Awesome purchase. Much better than Realme Wireless and Boat wireless that i had. Noise cancellation is almost much better any other bluetooth wireless that i had.. Back-up is super cool.,1
3259,"Bass is a bit low . Quality is great , including calls . Battery is unbelievably great , atleast 15 hours and charges completely in around 40 minutes. Connects seamlessly to iPhones also, quick turn on/off based on magnet is working too. Changing the active device , like switching to phone to attend a call , while listening to music to laptop , is very quick .You just double tap, and the connection is changed in 2-3 seconds. Overall, a great buy.",1

3262,"Everything is perfect about the product except the battery life for me. I think may be my headset is defective. It is not giving that much battery back up what mentioned. Probably 8 hr maximum for my case. I don't listen with very loud sound too. Charging speed is good, only battery backup is less for me. It has very good sound quality, even better than my Sennheiser cx 275s. Bass is also great. I like is type of deep bass. I don't know why people are blaming it for low bass.",1
3263,"Awasome product,  bass should be improve in it but enough bass to hear clear & fresh music. Sound quality is best.",1
3264,"This is an excellent wireless earphone. I should admit that Sound quality is fabulous & also the Bass is preety good. It's a balance sound quality.

3269,I loved it after using 1 week. Below are the points which I liked and loved most.1. Quick switch2. Battery backup3. Quick Charge even with my VOOC charger,1
3270,"First of all, Sound quality is 9/10Bass, I love bass but when it comes to bullet z we can definitely sacrifice 30% of bass over Its features and battery life.Most of them will prefer Bass for its Thump but if you just want ONLY BASS not the features, sound quality  and best battery then don't take ONEPLUS BULLET Z.ONEPLUS BULLET Z stands out with all other Features except BASS.. I loved it ..just go for it give it a try if you don't just Return it that's it..",1

3274,"As i expected as i want! Amazing sound quality but not for those who prefer bass, its batter backup is around 18 to 18.5 hrs which was really awesome. Build quality is quite nice, if i compare this whit realme neckband then ofcourse  both are same at some places and different at some,like the one who prefer bass go for realme neckband, otherwise if the bass is not the necessary part of your neckband the go for it(oneplus wireless bullets z)",1

I am using these on my Oneplus 7 device and performance may vary on devices other than OnePlus phones.Q. Does it work for gaming like Pubg?A. Yes it does. You'll experience a minor lag in sound but I think it's ignorable after an update OnePlus pushed for these earphones. The lag is negligible.

3475,"Those who are complaing about low bass... it's a humble request to you all please change the ear tips to a larger size and try to listen. Intially i was also not happy with the bass,but after changing ear tips omg class bass. Just awesome.",1
3476,"If you want to compare bass to other like I have boat 255 then you will definitely disappoint.So don't check comparison, bass is ok not too loud great battery backup. And great range.But  noise cancellation poor, it feel when you call someone in openspace.",1

Is anyone found the same issue..,1

3486,"So to the people who are saying that the bass is low, you guys are mistaken. Even though it shows that you are on the maximum voice limit on your phone just click the '+' button on your headset till you hear a beep sound.

I travel a lot and this is my primary earphones and that means the 20 hour battery is a very big advantage.

3897,"I got my earphones yesterday, it's sound quality is extremely good, that you cannot raise the volume even above 40, speaking about the bass it's better than boat 225 (as I've already used it). Especially the surrounding music gives you an amazing feel. speaking of the build quality the braided cables are good, but some people complaining that it's not having an L-shaped Jack, but for me it's not a problem as I've already used boat 225 earphones it has L-shaped Jack but it doesn't last so long...",1
3898,This product is just awesome. The sound quality is best in this price range. The bass lovers are loved this very much because it  was proved. The design is also nice but I thought the volume switch buttons are slightly handle to touch....,1

3902,"Got these headset after going through many reviews as i had previously used Jbl,boat, 1more etc. The so i was confused to either buy some costly headset or go for a bit cheaper. These headset are pretty loud with very good bass, even listening to soft music you can feel that song. I fel that it has good amount of bass with some surround sound effect.... Using it from past 2 weeks.. Satisfied till date.",1
3903,sound quality is crispy and clear.  base is good . the material of the wire is very good . finally I got a good headphone . if you want a durable headphone then go for it . if not boat rockers are also good option . but I prefer durable headphone which can long last like 3 years,1

Sound quality can be compared with earphones like that of JBL and BOAT, 3.5mm jack makes it more comfortable to use and fit in almost all mobile jacks. Bass quality is descent. Good for playing games like PUBGMobile, etc. Honestly the best earphones at low price.",1

3908,Realmi buds 2 very hard bass and sound quality much better. You feel high up music. It's compact size also good. It's 10-30% volume very slowly and 90-100 % sounds quality compromise not clear hearing people says . 30-80% volume very best for hearing music but every time you gets high and better bass. If audio jack are in shape of l types  connector than it much better.  It's a very good  earphones. I love this earphone .,1
3909,"I've been using this past 6 months.I'd say in terms of durability it matches with any sport version of Sennheiser.Bass is high, this affects the balance.Treble is high at 100% volume. Should listen to music at max 80% volume.Surround sound is excellent for watching movies, since its realme buds the Dolby Atmos can be utilised to its full extent.If the bass was not kicked up a notch and more money was put into clarity this would have matched with the likes of JBL.",1
3910,"Price worthy product..

3911,It is the best earphones you can get at this price range. Bass is superb and punchy. Vocals are pretty good. Cable quality is better than all earphones at this price point.I am using this with my Realme 6 pro and it is great. If your phone supports DOLBY audio then its a win-win.Also the cable organizer is really useful and handy.One downside is that it is plastic build but trust me it is a very good quality pastic and the construction is really sound.If it is plastic build it should ...,1

3915,Sound quality and design is superb. But i have to add something more important and considerable ::1. Best part of this earphone is wire coating. None of the other earphone give you this feature in such a price. I know it is not much matter but it keeps ur earphone safe.2. 2nd main part right placement of mic. Many other earphone miss this. This is necessary feature because you don't need to hold mic near ur mouth while in call.,1
3916,The product of awesome in quality. The base is good and most important the earphone can be used roughly as the build quality is good.,1

3928,"Very well balanced sound. Deep basslines, with no distortions at higher volumes. Value for money at 599!The magnetic eartips might seem useless, but that and the cable organizer do come in handy while keeping them away, as they remain tangle-free.",1
3929,"The earphones are made up of good quality material that has a fine texture and seems durable. As far as the quality of sound is concerned, these earphones provide a good quality sound in this price range. The better you keep the longer they'll last.",1
3930,"Get this amazing earphones from realme,great experience till now and found out that the mids are not that clear it's ok....ok, as well as the plastic body affects the design a lot,looks like an old gadget",1

3935,Packaging is quite Messy and look like old but the earphones are sounds good if you're a shot of deep and heavy music listener then I personally recommend you Sennheiser cx 180 the built quality is not good on Sennheiser but definitely worth your money and sound far better then this realme Buds 2,1
3936,This ear phones value for money but green colour is not good for look black is best for look. Bass quality is very super,1
3937,"Sound quality is good but u have to adjust equaliser first for balance you want. Fits comfortably in ears, build quality is also a plus point, buds doesn't feel heavy in ears because of plastic body, button controls gives volume option which is good, bass is thumpy but not over boosted. Overall decent product according to its price range.",1
3938,"Good Product i am un expected in this prich rang. In good sound quality and Bass. Design but ok normal. In this Product better than Cx180 (2/5), Buds 2 (4.5/5)....thanks to Realme....",1
3939,"Good build quality.Doesn't seem cheap. Doest cause pain in the ear.Sounds is quite clear and bass is good enough.Highs and lows are okay too.In all, a great product , specially in 500-600 range. Even jbl etc whose starting range is at 800 something won't give you this quality.Also, they do tangle as times but that is understandable.The magnet keep the sadbuddhi together which is a good thing which most of the wired earphones lack specially under 1k segment.Go buy the product.",1

Honestly, i didn‚Äôt get what i expected but then expectations comes at a cost and this one delivers almost everything u want in a ‚Äúbudget earphone‚Äù. Bass is terrific, vocals are not up to the mark ( at lower volume levels). Overall, if u are a bass lover and can compromise on other dimensions, this one is for you. Good luck.",1
3953,Best earphone i have ever purchased..Its doesn't feel as it is 600Rs earphone but actually it sounds better than some costly earphones.Build quality is just superb..And earphone organiser is the best which you dnt get it in any other earphones..Bass is so punchy which i like very much.,1

3959,Nice earphone with the superb sound quality and the built design   is very good. Very light and also comfortable to use.... overall nice product at this price rangeDescription of testing....Sound quality :- 9/10Built and design :- 10/10,1
3960,"So I'm a pubg player & bought it after viewing reviews in youtube. Nd i can say that they are best earphones. Nice build quality, nice sound, mid nd bass are good. You'll not regret.",1
3961,"Best Earphones you can get in this price, love the braided cable. Sound quality is top notch and it's loud as Frick! Bass is perfect, lows and mids are good and has a close to flat EQ. Go for it!Edit: it‚Äôs been six months now and this earphone is still a beast. I have faced zero problems and it‚Äôs super strong and durable. Lmao I have sat on it, smacked it against the wall and dropped it multiple times and it‚Äôs still good as new",1
3962,A good wired Headset indeed. I am using Boat bass head 220 which is one of the best thing I hv used and this headset is not less than that. Bass is good and clarity of sound is also at its best. 4star from my side.,1
3963,Sound quality and built is pretty good actually. Bass is not upto the mark. The only minor change is I wanted it to be L shaped. Other than this everything's absolutely worth it at this price range,1
3964,Good product for this prize best clear sound and basss,1
3965,Nice feel and good sound quality the build quality is impressive i am satisfied of this product,1
3966,"Wonderful earphones with mid range price segment... Cant compare with JBL or Skullcandy earphones interms of Bass.... Earlier I used JBL T210.Apart from the bass quality remaining all upto the mark.Especially for PUBG players are blessed to have such Realme buds 2 earphone. No delays, Clear foot steps sounds and 360 degree coverage of surrounded sounds while playing pubg and listening songs.No earphone as of now to compare with this Realme buds.No second thought in buying this one.",1
3967,This one is definitely better than the realme buds 1. It has surrounding sound good baas and a comfortable design.I really love the build quality also.,1
3968,Fir this price this is the best earphone that you can buy....sound quality is so good....bass is awesome....I love Loud music and this earphone gives that...wire quality feels good enough to last longer.... just go for it....this one is bang for the buck....,1
3969,Nice earphones. Built quality is also amazing. Sound is awesome üòç. This is the best earphones. Loved it,1
3970,"Product is  must purchase type...However I expected good packing, it's not covered by plastic cover.The day I got this product, it was raining....It's just about the packagingBut I must say it's a good quality productThank you FlipkartNext time I expect a good packingThank you.....",1
3971,"I've been using this headset for more than a month the audio output from this headset is worth more than the paid amount, it has such a great bass worth buying it.",1
3972,Thanks Realme . I never expected.  It's too good quality and wire sound beat. I'm already using JBL and Skullcandy but. It's too reasonable price and awesome quality.  Guy's I suggest to you . Must go for it . My next order now Realme Earbuds.  Surprisedü•∞üòò thanks again. So happy and Fully satisfied about your product. JBL products you need to update yourself because price too much but quality no. So guy's go for realme earphone,1
3973,Wow nice product Base nice fantastic ?I play Call of duity Game I am shocked if listen real sound Fantastic base ???,1
3974,"Firstly, I'm buying this third time one for me and two for my friends, so you don't have to worry about this product, the rugged wired finish is awesome and is tangled free and also it comes with cable manager,Apart from it, when it comes to bass, it's tremendous, just like what the Indian users likes also the mid, lows and highs are quite good, i'm quite satisfied with this product.",1
3975,realme buds 2 bass is good and audio quality toobut I have already used boat super bass 255f at this price 599 whose bass and audio level is same diff is realme drivers 11.2mm boat 10mm but I found the loudness and bass same so there is no diff with extra 1.2mm drivers in realme.I ordered this for extra bass whereas I found this same too as boat earphones.overall I give 4/5and 4.5/5to boat earphones,1
3976,The sound quality is good regarding the price point.The problem with the sound is that it is more focused on the instrumental side rather than vocals. And the concequence is that it sounds little bizarre. If it mixed up the instrumental and vocals more balanced then it would have been more soothing to listen.,1
3977,"Sound clarity is awesome...It does not distort at high volume and the vocals are clear even with high music in backgroundBass is kinda low punchyTrust me if you want good sound clarity and clear vocals this is the oneIf ur budget is a bit low say, rs 400 , then go for Boult audio bassbuds oakAnd choose the brown color...Have a nice day",1
3978,this earphone is really awesome but the feature I don't like is it's not support on my device properly,1
3979,Pro's: 1. Sound- Loud and clear.2. Bass - Too good for this price. Best under 10003. Call quality and mic - Very good.4. Build quality - Nylon braided cable.Cons but not really: 1. Headphone jack with/without gold coating doesn't matter much for normal usage.2. Headphone jack shape could be better if it would be in L shape. But it mitigates the cable life by providing nylon braided wire. Normal wires with straight headphone jack will worn out soon after regular usage.,1
3980,"These are the best earphones, great bass and clear voice. It is better than sennheiser cx180 street.5 out of 5.",1
3981,Cool and super durability. Good to say about the bass. Bass is more than expected. So I recommend to look at it,1
3982,"Bass isn't thumpy, but it's hydraulised. I enjoy it! ‡≤†_‡≤†You can cannot use this earphone at a higher volume, actually you can not increase your volume than 65%, it will cause your earpain if you take it further.Other than that, I love it! The wire arrangement shack is just making the work easier!!! Don't think much, just go for it!",1
3983,"This is very Affordable In terms of Price, Design and Quality. Quality is much appreciated and Sound clarity is awsome. We can hear even a tiny detail very clear. I like em a lot.",1

4020,"So I have been using Antaudio wave 506 and boat baseheads 225 for a while, and this realme earphone is quite good as compared to these two earphones.If Iam asked to chose one, I would chose realme buds 2. But , if you are the one who loves to listen music at 100% volume with best bass, I would suggest you to buy boat baseheads 225 or 220.",1
4021,"Awesome quality earphones in this price segment.first of all design and build quality is awesome , calls through headphone mic is crystal clear and sound quality and bass is awesome .If you confused between boat bassheads 220 and realme buds 2 ,as i have used both of them i would say pay 50 rupees more and blindly go for realme buds 2 ...it will give you a premium earphone quality sound",1

4034,Every thing is good except the sound clarity as it sound less sharp and more dull with any sound for example when playing games like Pubg the gun sound and footstep is not clear as  compare to other in price points. The 3d sound is very low You can not identify the location clearly,1
4035,Ear phones are really good but the only problem is with mic.At first proper voice is been heard by receiver on call but later on it is just going lower and lower. And the last thing it should have L shaped microphone jack with gold plating.. Overall at this price product is a fair deal.,1

Paying 599 for this earphones are worth .The sound quality is awesome , in the bass department no one can do it better than realme , the only con is that the headphone jack, which doesn't seems durable, if it would be a L shape jack then the durability may have increased , I think realme must improve it .

4078,It's base is amazing and sound quality is good but not best but I am satisfied in this price,1
4079,The built quality is superb... But the sound is a problem. The mids and lows arent that great here. However if your vol is above 70% youll enjoy the bass really well. I don't know why but when the sound is below or at 60% the treble and vocals are so aoft and not clear enough. So if budget is at bay and you are thinking of a bass centric in ear headphone u can go for it.,1

I rate the sound 3 because u will definitely find that it's loud bt it is tuned very straight u will feel the lack of crisp sound which comes from instrumentThe price is good üëç so u can go for it. But don't expect that unique  crystal sound which distinguish the vocals the mettalic  the bass. Ys it has bass but the reviews that it...",1
4236,It's bass is the best under the 1k budget segment but overall sound quality (vocals) could have been improved. Hope they will do it in their buds 3. I will definitely recommend this if you want earphones under 1k. Kudos to Realme.,1
4237,"Bass is good in these buds and quality is also awesome but audio output is not upto the mark for games like pubg ,here audio output is satisfactory otherwise the overall quality of the product is good.",1
4238,the earphone is good for bass lover sound quality also nice at the price point but if you listen it at full volume for more than 30 mni after that you get little head paining,1
4239,Nice sound quality at this price and design is also awesome. And best things are one is cable organizer and 2nd one is magnet in buds .these two things are very helpful,1

4283,It's okay. Neither too boombasstic like boat which comes in the same price range. No Lshaped pin makes it a little uneasy to put the phone in the pocket while driving. Doesn't go well with tight jeans. Fits well in ear though. Very light-weight. You wouldn't know if it's there. Excellent noise cancellation. Suitable for games like Pubg and Freefire. Conclusion: Best for normal heads*...kaam chalau earphones for bassheads* like me. xDD,1

But the boat has slightly more bass than this one but if i will talk about the overall experience then its simply awesome considering its price point. You can easily compare this earphone with some of the jbl earphone  which comes under similar price range like T160,C150SI etc.",1

Perhaps this is the best ever earphone i ever had... if you are planning to buy earphone within 1000 rs probably this is the only i recommend you to go for. believe me you won't regret. just go for it man don't look for anything else.. yes just go for it. click on the buy now button and it's  yours. enjoy the rich experience of music.,1

I'm having Moto one power and when increasing the volume via the earphone buttons google assistant is popping up everytime...other functionality are working well.I think the buttons aren't compatible with Android 10 and also in Windows 10 the total button functionality can't be used.It's the best in this price.The boat 220/225 earphone just has a little more loudness an...,1
4343,"Guys it is really a fabulous earphones at this price range .. I've using this for the past 3 months and i hav to say, the sound quality is remarkable , really, really great, and the bass was quite impressive!! If wheather you're buying this for PUBG u can definitely go for it only if ur phone supports ultra sound otherwise i wouldn't recommend it. Overall I would give it a solid 9/10 .",1
4344,best product at this price range I love this earphone damn what a bass nothing can compete with this earphone just go for it u ll love it I'm sure thank me later,1
4345,"Totally love with this budget earphone. Realme brings real smile after listening the sound quality from the earphones.Noise cancellation is there, Bass quality is fair enough, in short if any marks given to this earphone I'll give 9/10?",1
4346,These headphones are totally amazing at 599/- it beats every headphones available in the market under 1500/- price tag. Buy it with close eyes I guranteed the sound quality is not amazing but excellent in this price range.,1
4347,very good  quality. sounda clarity excellent.  bass is there...  powerful sound cant listen at high volume because  it is too loud..  overall good  my rating 4/5,1
4348,must buy product... if you want good sound quality... if for only style purpose you go for Bluetooth earphones... really nice product üëå thank you flipkart,1
4349,Awesome  Headphone  . Love the built quality Love the Bass.  Awesome package,1
4350,superb bass and awsm sound quality. good when u use it for calling purpose also. And the wire quality is also so good in this price range.,1
4351,awesome product at perfect price. Super bass & perfect sound quality. Just love it so much.,1
4352,Realme Buds 2 Are Really Good Earphone and the Cable Organizer Is Trully The Best only the Vocal Should be more improved But The Bass Is excellent And Overall tha earphone is best in this price,1
4353,"one of the best earphones in this price range. The sound quality is of top class. If I come to the point of bass the eopper will be the boult bassloops. But If I talk about the overall sound quality, design the first boy of the class is Realme Buds 2. Very good earphones in this price range. You can go with it.",1
4354,"The best bass you can get in around 600. I was initially skeptical about realme but rating of 4.5 and good customer reviews lured me to order one. Now, after roughly 10 days of usage I'm highly satisfied with the product and it's sound quality. I have a Sony MDR EX15 which costed me Rs. 1200/- but the bass of realme beats it. You get 11mm driver just at around 600!. I highly recommend it",1
4355,Very well product quality üëåsound quality 4.8/5.0 Really whenever I listen songs and watching video using this earphones it feels like I am in theatre. A very dynamic product from realme üëç,1
4356,bass is too good better dan jbl earphones only problem is it darins ur phones battery little fast Dan jbl but u get good sound fr dat,1
4357,Magnet & tie are simply eye catching in this range. Clear sound. Volume control should have been improved a bit. Overall best designed n quality.,1
4358,very rugged earfone in this price segment.i am completely satisfied wid this earfone but if realme could provide whole braided cable then it will be worth every penny.As mentioned in the box the bass is superb but the vocal is little bit low but it's negligible.out of 10 i will rate it 7 just because of half braided and half polypropylene cable.otherwise it will be 9 out of 10.apart from this the delivery was on time.and finally thanks to flipkart.,1
4359,Its good for the price but I suggest jbl cs150si because it has much better bass compared to realme buds 2 also i have tested with 3 other earphones In bassMivi thunder beats =10/10Senhiser cx 180 = 10/9Jbl cs150si           =10/8Realme buds 2.    = 10/7And in terms of sound quality all are best the best of best under 1000 is senhiser cx180 it is the beast also in sale you will get mivi thunder beats for 1099 rs in this price thunder beats are killing deal and also for bass lovers mivi ...,1
4360,sounds quality is very good and bass is balanced that feel good bass overall good earphones,1
4361,Pretty good loking headphone. Bass is superb. Clarity is also decent. You get mic+volume buttons along with play/pause button. All in a single product. You can definitely consider this for your next buy.,1
4362,"damn!! realme this has just insane quality sound, I mean i just can't explain how happy i am being a bass lover also soft music!! Yes this sounds far better than Sony, jbl, sennheiser etc!! And lastly I would say Mi you are big zero in front of realme right now!! upgrade your accessories!!!",1
4363,"Really awsome, Ear blast earphones, I was brought boAt headset 15 days earlier but not satisfied and realme beats the boAt. worth of money, thank a lot to flipkart for this product. I want give 10 stars out of 5.",1

4366,"The headphones are good and they sound decent like Boat 220, JBL T100 and every other decent headphones. But as the reviews say, there is nothing extraordinary or unique about. I believe this is the myth about selling a new product by adding oriented reviews. Thanks Flipkart for a the quick delivery!",1
4367,Sound quality is awesome but not clear as senhizer but as compared to senhizer it's difference of only few  clearity built quality is good but its gold plated cord company should improve this and rest of quality is same as senhizer only sound clearity is too less as senhizer bass is equal as senhizer and biggest thing is that its budget earphones with extra ear buds,1
4368,I know how it feels when u find the best products... I feel the same with this earphone... build quality... sound quality... mic quality for call... everything is top notch... I am actually in love with this beast...,1
4369,very nice sounds good Basse good quality iam happy total Mark 10/10,1
4370,"These earphones are steal. Bass is outstanding. Good thing is bass is not disturbing other frequencies (mids, highs). Vocal are clear enough but I won't say outstanding. Instrument seperation is very nice similar to any other earphones under the price of 2000. Build quality is excellent but personally I don't like the yellow accent because it's funky for myself. If you want earphones under 500 I'll recommend to go with Honor AM115 it has same sound quality but the build is just above average....",1

Sound Quality: The drivers definitely produce a very balanced sound that is surely going to satisfy most of the people including me.

4577,"The sound quality is really good and it's worth every penny. But the unit I received had some manufacturing defect so after around 3 months of use, the volume in the left side kept decreasing for a week and then completely stopped. Thanks to the one year warranty I took it to the service centre for replacement. And they said I'll get the new one in 7 to 10 days! That's a long time for a music lover to stay without earphones... I also checked the OnePlus website and there were a lot of people ...",1

4580,Simply outstandingReview after 5days of heavy usageFirst thing to look after when we have earphones like these is battery and it these r fentastic charge for 10mits and it serves you a whole day and even more too.The second best thing is the bass and sound quality and it is simply the best.The next thing is design and pricing. These Bullets reached these specifications too..Overal rating is 10/10 perfect.,1
4581,Sound clarity is too good in comparison of realme wireless and also bass is far better from realme wireless.bass is reaching in the core.,1
4582,"Too good... At last 1+ improved in sound dept. You can feel each and every single note and the most good thing is you can hear tempo in one bud and others in the 2nd bud. I mean, the surround sound sistem is too good",1
4583,"I am happy with the product I received. Packed tightly and got genuine product.This is after 10days review.I charged for 3time only- battery backup really niceNo irritation at all while placingThere is no noise cancellation i think but voice will be clear for receiving personSounds are really amazing I will re edit again after 20daysDesign, build quality is nice and I don't feel wires will sustain for long periods use.No irritation even after placing it for 10hrs.Nice one... Good ...",1
4584,Compared to OnePlus bullets z this has far better bass and also built quality is good. The sound quality is also good....not as good as LDAC sound system but it is decent overall.,1
4585,No doubt this neckband was a beast but reason for giving 4 star is sometimes when I use microphone during games it doesn't work properly my teammates didn't hear me properly BTW it's good choice for me only I face sometimes microphone issue.,1
4586,"Very good product. Sound clarity is fine but due to extra bass some instruments and vocals are faded sometimes! Design and build is good too except there is no cover for the type-c port! Battery backup is too good...no issues there. And comfortable too, itchiness or something like that doesn't happen after using for long hours. Microphone is good, no issues from the other side. And low latency mode best in this price range...even with a non-Oneplus device( I've a Samsung phone ). Overall valu...",1

5297,"First of all, size of the product is very small and handy, it can easily fit in your pocket. Battery backup is good as of now.Call quality is average, not expecting more...Sound quality is good for bass lovers, but not crispy. I'm using sony Headset (wired) while compared it's average.Usb type c is missing but not a issue.Interfaces - touch controls are average. Overall your budget is 1500 to 2000 consider to buy.",1
5298,Bass is not that much good . But the quality of vocals and loudness is absolutely fabulous .Although i face some connectivity problems with the left bud sometimes but overall a good purchase .pretty much much happy with my decision,1

5305,Bought them in 1499 20 days ago...battery is 2 hrs for songs 1.5 hrs for call for a single bud. But the box can fully charge them in 30 minutes so no problem ..mic connectivity during call is also very good seems like hd calling but for a better experience you may require a calm place.

5900,Awesome colour! Amazing experience .. but only the charging data cable is not of good quality and adjustable clip is not so tight.,1
5901,"For the first time, I am posting a review, just because the product compelled me to do so. Icouldn't find a single aspect missed or mis-handled by Boat. Well this is called, quality engineering. Well, some people say Boat enhances bass and thus compensates with clarity, but I would give my neutral and true feedbackBass : 10/10Clarity : 9/10Comfort ease n looks : 15/10Features :10/10The best buy from flipkart yet..",1
5902,First of all the Delivery boy is a good guy. Nice receive and responce. Product is super. Packing also good.  I fell Red color is not sufficient for me. Otherwise totally awesome product. Delivery is too long. Iam taking one week after booking. Thankyou flipcart and boat 235v2 also.,1

5908,"Good product. Never used bluetooth headset before. Now I am happy to see ease in my work. As I noticed boat marketing their products aggressively in market in recent days. About product it's like awesome having better build quality, bass is good, battery backup is fine and vibration though it vibrates my neck when ever I gets call but still feature is must needed when u are driving. Wanted to give 5star but there is a sentence that "" Nothing is perfect in this imperfect world"" üòÑüòÑüòâ",1

5923,Boat rockerz 235 v2 is the budget blutooth hearphone. All are very good performance only sound quality is slightly poor.. vibration and battery backup is the best part in this product. Bass also very great .. just lysric clearing not proper,1
5924,If you are a bass lover then blindly go for it . And I think 8 hours of backup is enough and 4 hours charge in 20 mins .what else we want . Superb,1
5925,"Review after about 2months of usage.Before starting let me be clear, THIS DEVICE IS NOT FOR SERIOUS MUSIC LOVERS/AUDIOPHILES.I'm not gonna repeat the same technical aspects of it, you already know what's inside it. So...Coming to the sound, if you just love some BASS and heavy sounds this earphone will become your best buddy in no time. The volume on this is insane. I only use it at 20-30% max. It's very loud.

6027,"Guys, today I got my order. The sound quality and the bass is awesome. but don't buy this for PubG as you get latency. you will hear after 2 - 3 secs of firing, footsteps, and messages. So, for music and calls its pretty good but for gaming don't buy this. Go for 255F for PUBg.",1
6028,Good product. But if u want for playing PUBG ITS NOT GOOD TOO MUCH AUDIO DELAY. I TRY LOTS OF THINGS TO FIX BUT . ITS DIDN'T WORK. FOR MUSIC AND CALLS ITS GOOD BUT FOR PUBG I DON'T RECOMMEND THAT ONE.,1

6031,"Better than expected! Great Indian product, very clear and bass is super. Due to high bass, peak volume makes more sound which can't be avoided in this type of earphones. Long quality cables. It's slipping from ear as it has more weight in outside, it's required for high bass earphones. That's the reason, ear hook is given along. Buttons and mic is good.",1
6032,The best earohones so far. The buil quality is little cheap but it won't feel that much... Sound quality is good and bass is alsoo good .. overall worth the price.,1
6033,Great headset With mind blowing bass and decent sound...Nervous abt the built quality finishing is not too good but still i enjoy the music overall this is the best product i suggest to purchase...,1

Battery life is decent and charge time is quick.A few times there is some sort of connection problems and the headset keeps disconnecting and reconnecting, but it happens only once or twice in 2 to 3 days so nothing to worry about.Also while answering calls sometimes though the headset is connected you wont be able to answer and the inbuilt vibrator wont stop even after answering the call through your phone.Nice mids and averag...",1
6038,Awesome product it is very useful to taking call while on drive and good designed for wire strip come with this is good to see totally worthy to purchase,1

A real noticeable gap that can make video different.2) connectivity is fast but sometimes showing connected but doesn't playing audio in earphone.3) treble is low and bass is high so sometimes in some song you will feel need of treble .Conclusion:-A good earphone with very sleek design a...,1
6055,"These earphones are really amazing and worth buying. .. only for those who loves playing song , movies or for gym purpose ... Those who wants to buy it for pubg .. i request u not to buy...

6169,So I have been using these for about a month now. The battery backup is good which usually lasts 8 to 9 hours. But you can't actually use once it reaches 20 percent. It starts annoying you with 'battery low' message every 20 seconds or so. They could have set the annoying threshold to 5 percent. And driving on 2 wheelers with these is a nightmare. It flies away if you drive fast even while not using it with the magnetic earbuds connected. Sound and bass is good considering its price (899)The...,1

I've never charged it for more than 30 minutes and it stays live whole day. 3. Sound quality is good, not the best. 4. Latency is there. So if you're planning to play online games like COD Or PUBG it'll get you killed. Expect a minimum 1 second delay.5. Phone calls won't be private anymore, you'll need to speak louder than usual in order to make conversations ...",1

7297,"Everything is fine, just need improve the bass, and one thing many users have said does not work one side, tell them u reset once  and then both will work, the battery is very good and excellent performance but many people will have a slight pain in the ear while using it first time, but will not do it when they get used to it after a few days, in the last I will just say that u will not get any good from it at such a low price,  THANKS boAt INDIA & THANKS Flipkartüòçüòç",1
7298,Thank you flipkart for the fastest delivery got this airdopes delivered within 24 hrs ....

7299,"I never bought any kind of Bluetooth pairs, this was my first purchase and I can say this was the best purchase at this segment. The quality of the product and music is outstanding and I never expected that to in this price. Thank you, Flipkart for the express delivery which you offered.",1
7300,"Worth buying, great product in this price, looking stylish, I like one feature in this we can also connect one earbud with one phone and 2nd with another phone, so that 2 people can use this with different device.",1
7301,I think it is worth....Sound :- Sound quality is good but sometime music is stop for mili sec...btw in this price range no company provide like this...Build quality :-is good but the blue blinking light irritate me and beacuse of blue light it looks cheap...Battery :- good battery backup ...no problem,1
7302,Best product you can buy in this price range. Sound quality is good and connecting speed is really fast and battery backup is also good.,1
7303,Fabulous in this range.. 1. Sound quality is very good2. Premium built quality and look.. from inside it may feel like plastic3. Battery backup is good..4. If you love bass the don't go for it..5. It doesn't block your ear.. you can hear surrounding voice while using it,1

7306,"It's nice overall mainly because of the low price. It has pressable button towards the outer part by pressing which one can receive/reject call, play/pause music. The bass is not upto the mark. Call quality is nice. But what else you need for such low cost. Good for those who don't like in-ear silicone earphones.",1

7309,"It is definitely a good purchase at this price, those who don't care for loud bass and thing, they can go for this, these Airdopes are perfectly balanced in terms of sound, the sound doesn't breaks at high volumes, you can still enjoy your songs smoothly. The normal calling with this works perfectly, no as such issues there, but you may find bit issues on WhatsApp calls, as voice tends to break sometimes. You can use one airdope at a time and it works perfectly.Lastly, the battery backup, i...",1
7310,Good for the priceSound if loud and clear. Bass is there but not best as these are not in-ear type. Call quality is good. And battery lasts 3.5 hrs. Good thing is type-C I can use my OnePlus charger with it. Comfortable for long hours.Dont expect too much from the product at this price. I would say if you don't want to spend much then get this. And obviously if your priority is sound quality then Sony and Bose are only option.,1
7311,Nice headsets. Great sound quality. Finest design.Will be better if bass also gets improved.overall nice and best @ this price rangeüëå,1
7312,"The earphone got delivered in 1 day. Speaking of sound quality the sound is good you get decent amount of base for the price. The design though is not upto the mark you cannot wear it for prolonged hours as it gets uncomfortable. The microphone is ok calling experience is ok not that great. Battery backups i cannot comment on that as I haven‚Äôt used it a lot. But for the price that you are paying ,this thing is totally worth the buy.",1

7315,"So actually these are very impressive at such low price. Boat has been always knows for delivering great sound. Its just the product quality should have been a bit more high because it will get scratches on the go.. One thing is that you cannot hold it for longer as the ear start paining. short duration is ok to use. I already owe One plus z buds , those are really very comfy. Haven't tested the backup but I believe it will pass that too.‚ô•Ô∏èThe sound part is actually a bit heavy and not so c...",1

7327,"It's a nice product in this price range, but I would say a few points which boat needs to work on:1. boat should manufacture protective covers for the outer case, as I feel that it's really fragile and I'm unable to find some cover.2. It would be really good if they would have added touch controls in it. 3. The blue led which flashes in every 5 second should be turned off. It gives a really cheap look.",1

There is, however, no punchy bass and is very hard to achieve even with equalizers. 2) Battery lasts for quite a long time. It lasted me a full day of online classes with a mix of Netflix and YouTube content which all adds up to 8+ hours. 3) Range is quite good and I have observed no hitches. 4) The physical buttons are good...",1

7941,This is a genuine review. Cros:For this price point this ear phones are perfect.It has mic which was very good. At this price. The sound quality is perfect and They will fit exactly in your the earsand it is completely awful.This will make neutral satification to play pubg as well.Cons:And the only thing this which is hesitating is little confusion among buds which is right and which is left,1
7942,Writing this review after 6 months of usage.Sound clarity is very good. Not a single issue had come till now with it. The bass is nice but if you want more bass then I suggest you to go with the other product i.e. BoAt Bassheads 103. But if it's not the case then this one is best for you. It's truly value for money! Go for it!,1
7943,This boAt BassHeads 100 has a decent sound quality but the Bass for which boAt is Known is too low so didn't give u a perfect sound quality but still good in its price segment,1
7944,Superb Crisp Sound And Distinctive Sound Experience..If You want a Clear Crisp and HD Bass Experience. this One I would Recommend. I Tried All other Earphones But Sound i Clear And Crisp... luv u Flipkart ‚ò∫... And BoAT Accs Ltd... Muaaaaaaaahüòòüòòüòò,1
7945,It has better grip than others in the ears. One thing I noticed is that you feel like sound is coming straight from the phone and not through your ear phone. Many times I had to remove the ear phones to check whether the sound comes from the phone or from the ear phones. Good experience.,1
7946,quality of the headphone is awesome and bass is superb  i am happy with this product üòÑüòÉ,1
7947,Well it's a more than good earpiece at this price range. Not for bass lovers. Vocals and instrumentals feels well balanced. You can feel the decent beats. Don't expect too much at this price point.Use it with care otherwise it'll damage soon. ***personal experience***,1
7948,"Its a good earphone overall. It possesses a good design, but has extremely thin wires especially at the upper part, so one has to handle it carefully. Where it shines is the sound quality. Trust me it has the best possible bass output when compared to other earphones in the same price segment. But don't expect that it will give you the same sound quality as Rs2000 jbl or Skullcandy ones. This is fine for day to day usage but if you want to buy an earphone for solely listening to music then go...",1

8012,Good one. I Bought this and MI Basics together (boat for brother) I am satisfied with both. Both had same specs and audio quality. But I felt that Boat was sound good on non-MI phone (which is his) and MI one best work on MI phone(mine). Boat buds were quiet lighter than MI buds and it would survive more damages than MI. 1 year warranty on boat as compared to 6 months of MI. Both are satisfying and worth buying.,1
8013,Just go for this !!!I have bought various earphones but none of then are good or even close enough to this earphones The only draw back for this earphone is the mic is where the left and right wire are connected so when over call you need to lift up the mic near to  your face for clear audio otherwise it will give you a very good audio while watching movie listening music or playing games such as pubg in which coordination is requiredNot to think much just go for it !!!,1

Rest, it maintains a perfect balance between bass and treble.Go for it if you are not fond of high bass. Cons - feels very delicate because of its thin wires, but if handled carefully, they are really good at this price point. Overall, 8/10.",1

8220,this is actually the third order which I have placed . I have been using this for almost two years and just that the earphones are fine can give u the idea of robustness of the product.  further the bass and sound quality is average but considering the price range it's not too bad too. Further the mic works well and is an added advantage in this range of earphones. So go ahead in case you need a durable headset below 400. ps: got it for 365 which I think is justifiable.,1

8345,Does the job...... I think the only Indianbrand meeting the expectations. Bass is good sound quality is good but not crystal clear as used to be around in 2008-9 earphones which we can't get today but worth for the price.,1

8353,"it's a very good earphone in a very reasonable price and of course it's a boat which is a trustworthy brand but only thing by which I am not very much satisfied is it's bass , it's sound is very clear but quite low but not bad it's a very very good earphone,, everyone should try this once,, Loved it üòòüòòüòò",1
8354,I am using this head phone since last 2 months. it is good not best sounds quality is nice but as named boAt bassheads. I didn't get bass. so give 4 star.,1
8355,it's been only one day since I got it..so it is working perfectly fine. sound quality is good. bass also working fine. hopefully it will work like this for an year. design is also perfect. I got it for for 389 bucks so worth for the money I paid.,1
8356,"Sound quality is good and bass is also cool and extra ear buds are also provided but the wire quality is not good,it is very thin.Overall quality of the product is good within this price but BOAT should do something about the wire quality otherwise it is all good.",1
8357,"it's really worth product to purchase, the quality of the product is good ,and it has good and pleasant voice quality just loved it",1
8358,1st of all this is not a chargable product it is true wired earphones and its packaging material and product making material all is good and sound is just wow at this price with the bass you loved it believe me but at once youu won't disappointed with this product 100% i am sure i am enjoying music and movie every day 2hr at least  and it sounds good. Thanquuu boat to giving me such or5oduct at cheap price....üôèüôè,1
8359,BOOM. This headset is just perfect in the price segment. Superb Sound Quality and good build. Always been fan of boAt and this brand never disappoints. Got it around 349 during BBD and I guess that should be the price for the product. For sure one can buy these.,1
8360,"Design is awesome, product is good and well packed ,sound & bass quality is also good, I am really happy from this product buy from flipkart,just say that I am really awesome & enjoyed.",1
8361,this is very good product.sound quality lis good . but buds are not well to the ears.,1
8362,Good one nyc sounds. Audio quality is best for this price. If you looking for bass go for MI headset at same rate. Best for gaming,1
8363,nice product...but the bass is not upto the mark...looks are very nice...noise cancelation is good ....overall a good buy in this price,1
8364,ok. honest review. these headphones are very good looking no doubt! good and clear sound. But almost no base and depth. I bought two headphones this one and mi basic earphones. mi gave me better sound quality and bass than this. in some songs without the bass(even if it's light) you won't enjoy listening to it. hope boat bassheads 100 will be durable enough coz I use my headphones roughly.,1
8365,"Obviously, the bass is not very in line with more better products of Boat, but this one is a good proxy if you have a low budget. Also, the design is very cool to look at",1
8366,"I bought these headphones on a discount . Thankfully these are value for money . You can easily listen to music or watch series/movies even at a lower volume since the sound quality is excellent.  the bass is good but could be improved . If you are looking to buy headphones that are not too expensive but has better long-lasting quality  , I would suggest this brand . However - and this goes for every headphones of every brand out there in the market- it would be wise to regulate the use of he...",1
8367,Nice  products but sound and bass quality vary vary good product. Good looking . so beautiful and sound quality good,1
8368,"Excellent Base and ClarityI am writing this review after using this product for 1 month. Considering the price, the headphone has very good base and voice clarity. It seems like the person is standing next to u when u r talking with someone. Listening music is a great experience. If u listening some heavy base and musical songs, u can't listen in full volume for a long time. Overall extremely satisfied with the product.",1
8369,Very great headset at this price and the build of it is amazing because I use it roughly everyday and it works very well.,1
8370,This is awesome headphone sound is very clear.for more better quality you can plug it to laptop sound quality is mind blowing.  its been 3 months I'm using it roughly but its working properly.if you want a earphone for travel purpose this will be the best choice.,1
8371,Probably one of the best earphones i had used in a while the build looks not very good at first but after a whole year of usage all the stuff they earphones have gone through its a pretty good and sturdy pair of earphones with too good sound quality for that price and is loud enough to isolate yourself in public surroundings one of best purchases i hg made on this website as a whole,1
8372,firstly it is a good product... It has really clear sound from other headphone in this range...Though it's build quality is not up to the mark but it's sound quality compensates that.....It's bass quality is good....lastly within this 400 range it is the best headphone for every one.....,1
8373,Nice but not good enough to satisfy my expectations üòè,1
8374,üëçüëçüëçOrdered in FEB 19 using since then headphones are very good they are with great SOUND quality the BASS is moderate All vocals & Tunes are also very clever Overall very good performance and VALUE FOR MONEY  peice it is ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§,1

8377,is a good product..but failed to work after 4 months... warranty was for a year...but still satisfied because it worked great for me for 4 months,1
8378,"Ideal for those who like to listen to music with more bass. The design of the ear piece is good and it fits perfectly. Good for listening to music, but not ideal for movies, the extra bass makes it uncomfortable to listen subtle dialogues  and slow scenes. Overall this is a good product",1

The entire hassle-free process of replacement took 15 days but I ended up with completely new ones. High...",1

8394,One of the best earphone in this price range. It has great sound with good bass but the clarity of sound is not that much as expected.,1
8395,expected better than it is . good but you can make it more good boat .,1
8396,enchanting and safe packed one.best quality and bass sound... i like it.... superb for this rate,1
8397,A good Product on this price. Good Built Quality. Useful for normal users or ordinary people. Not good for those who wish for high bass.,1
8398,Really cool looking earphones. Loved the design.. But the bass is not that punchy.. It's just normal bass. I feel like my JBL earphones have better bass than these. Sound quality is not that bad.,1
8399,"Best quality earphones, awesome looks, great base, and light weight, so much better than other earphones in it's price range.",1
8400,this is my first lead of boat but this lead is very good and I like sound of this lead,1
8401,A decent headphone for everyday use. You can't expect much in this price range but it will amaze you by its sound quality. The build quality is also good considering its price point. Go for it if you have budget around 400rs.,1

8411,"I have the boat rockerz 255 sports wireless headset, and I have been using it for a month now. On comparing the bassheads to the rockerz, first of all,  the bassheads is more comfortable than the rockerz, but it has negligible bass as compared to the rockerz. The sound quality is comparable, and is at par with other earphones like Sennheiser cx-275s, jbl, etc. Overall, it is a really good earphone in this price range.",1
8412,great value for money... you can trust boat to deliver decent sound not amazing but great for this kind of money,1
8413,I recommend JBL compare to this earphone. JBL is little costlier but can play all types of music on any device. Boat works fine when it's DJ Remix etc but not that great to listen to soul soothing songs. Like peaceful romantic songs by Arijit Singh. I bought JBL C150si for Rs 699/- after wasting my money on this boat Bassheads 100.,1
8414,best in class. affordable with 1 yr warranty. built quality is great. best for gifting purpose. pure bass and good noise cancellation.,1
8415,very good product in low range. sound is very good. if you are bass lover then go for another one. It has a bass but not good one but as compare with prize is very very good ‚úåÔ∏è  But really nice one in very low range,1

8417,It's a good option if your on a tight budget. It works fine for me.,1
8418,"Got this for Rs 375, with fast delivery. Overall Sound is good. Bass is not great but it's ok. Mic also works fine. Comfortable with ear. Build and wire quality is good. If you want earphone for regular use and want an less budget earphone then this is perfect for you, definitely go for it. Plus it comes with one year warranty.",1
8419,"Its an awesome piece man. at this price range even sony one cannot beat it. Surprised by its sound, boat knows its platform. Quality is also durable, good quality rubber so cables do not get messed up. Just one line, Awesome sound delievered. Go for it. At this price range, you not gonna find anything better than this.",1

8428,"Good for bigeners ! Definitely not for the ones who love to have high bass but offcourse voice is clear, so as mic, design is excellent, overall a good purchase",1
8429,pretty neat setup.sounds good with descent bass and good treble.the mic seems a bit far and the other person complains of having less volume on call via the mic. Rest all good!,1
8430,Thought it'll be normal as i got it for low price...but the bass and beats and sound effect... Different ...well designed and unique style....good comfort and best quality.... I got this price for 499.... And i love boAt,1
8431,This is the best earphone available in the market for this price. Boat is the best as of now.,1
8432,"best in class,  and it's truly worth it. and is this prize simply superb product with ample amount off bass.",1
8433,The bass is great compared to other earphones. The design and build quality is just awesome. And the earbuds are so comfortable they smoothly adjust in your ears.,1
8434,my previous boat 220 slipped from ears often and it lasted  only a year. first the mic didn't work anymore and the following week the left earpiece got damaged too :( This boat 100 has better sound quality but bass is less than that of 220 but its fine. earphone fits perfect and it does not slip down like 220. I'm satisfied.,1
8435,i liked it very much. bass is low and didn't like the built quality that much. but it is a good buy.,1
8436,They're baby pink & so girly I love that about these & also these look so chic. Sound quality & all is good for the price I would not say extraordinary though. But one thing I've identified is that these are easily slipping off my ears I should change the buds to fit right in. They give you 3 sizes of buds to go with and the medium size one comes prefixed. summed up it's value for money,1
8437,Its a beast in this price segment. It is the best in-ear headset under 400. It has the best built quality as well as great sound quality with awesome clarity and bass. M using this headset since last 5 months and I am really satisfied with its performance.,1
8438,Boat is always a good brand and it's products are good and this is also good.......love it ... thank you .....,1
8439,top notch performance by this headset if your a bass lover then it will be a better choice .,1
8440,"Sound quality is good , but it has low bass .. so if you love bass don't buy it otherwise the product is good ...I had this earphones and it worked for 10 months and after that it stop working .. but if you will handle it with care then surely it will last for 1-2 years ..",1

8454,"I am overall satisfied with this product. Good build quality, comfortable with the ears, unique design, bass is also decent when it comes to earphones. While wearing these, it would not mute the surroundings completely which is a positive aspect of earphone products.",1
8455,this product is worth for what we spend on it 399/- it is working pretty good I am using it from last 3months,1
8456,sound was really good & jst  like the product & it was wonderful experince thank u flipkart,1

8466,"In short, great. Bass is superb with a nicely tuned equilizer. I've provided the ratings just not keeping in mind the price, but it actually performs. Only thing I found not suitable for me is the output is more on treble side in general. To give an example, if you're familiar with Poweramp, I use Bass and Treble preset. With this earphone, I used Bass Extreme to get relative output. However, this perspective is compared to Xtra Bass earphones from Sony. This is not an issue with a good equil...",1
8467,Absolutely superb at this price point. Don't think just buy. Very very comfortable not slippery like any plastic earphone. This item don't need any review. Love it.,1

8471,"Probably the best earphone for under 499rs.Bass is remarkable, mic is flawless, wire is superb quality.Just one drawback, it has a simple jack.Mi earphones provide a L-shape connector for safety, but they lack in bass which this earphone excels in. If ur looking for earphones under 500rs price, kindly go for this one.",1
8472,Amazing product considering the price point. I have been using earphones starting from the days when I used to carry a walkman with me every where I went. Best buy for me since the pricey brands which I used to purchase spending over 5k on my audio cravings.Trust me I cannot appreciate boAt for delivering such an amazing product at a throwaway price.

8590,It's bass is Preety nice but after taking it to Max you would get a hizz Or you can say high pitch annoying sound which is definitely not Acceptable. Would recommend you to take only when you have a budget of 400 and if you don't have any budget problem then go with the JBL earphone they have more bass and sound enhancer like stuffs inbuilt in earphones. That's all for my experience after using it.I would definitely not happy with the naterialy they used in this Price as it could be more bett...,1

The product is as good enough than my expectation. sound clarity is remarkable and noise cancellation works tremendous in it. lastly I will say if you are looking for a good quality branded daily use headphone along with...",1
8614,Just go for it. I used mi  price of 399/- but that stooped working within month. this boat heads working like charm.. Amazing clear sound nd bass.. at price of 349/-,1
8615,Nice product don't think that it has plastic body it is having nice build quality. Sound quality awesome i had tried on pubg also it feels like dolby atmos.,1
8616,When i used for 1st week everything was best and better But now bass and sound quality is not as first i used. with in 2 weeks quality was poor. But it's not happen to every earphone depends on what qualitie you get. Go for it best earphone.,1
8617,Product was good design and packing are good. But not felt like bass and sound quality are great compared with other boat headphones. The sound quality is normal.,1
8618,the best product in it's segment......soon soothing sound and powerful and clear bass that u can feel! just wow.....and tq Flipkart as I received the product 4 days before the delivery date!,1
8619,best earphones at this price range. best sound best base and best quality..,1

8624,best inear type earphone sound quality is awesome and wire quality is also very best highly recommended for this price range,1
8625,I think it's the best earphone under 1K category you can even feel the thump of music....awesome sound quality with amazing bass and balanced treble..Go for it for sure‚ô•Ô∏è,1
8626,The sound quality is very impressive but according to its name it does not give that much of bass as expected. The cable could've been a bit longer. The button interface is quite amazing and useful. In total it's a good set but the name is not appropriate according to its performance and it could've been better.,1
8627,Good quality for everyday use. Although it claims it is bass rich but there is not enough bass. So it will disappoint the high bass music lovers. The functional key is good and you can perform all the function which it has claimed with very ease.,1
8628,it is good product. bass is very good. but I think that if smoothness of wire can more smooth and sound quality is good but in full volume sounds is not clear.,1
8629,Excellent sound quality. Good fit to ear. Though mic quality could have been better. But within this price range its a great buy,1
8630,"It is the best earphone i hv ever used. its AWWSOMMME. Pure quality product. delivered in 4days. The delivery boy is also well behaved. In one word ""SATISFIED""",1

8647,Boat earphone sound quality is really nice. High bass and clear sound even in high volume also comfortable for several hours of listening. hot keys make it easy of receiving calls during driving also help to skip songs. The only problem is it doesn't have volume button.  Price under budget.,1

Coming to its sound quality, it has good bass with clear sound but you might need to adjust it according to your appropriate ear buds, since the sound depends on them accordingly. Final Verdict: Its one the best earphones that you can ever have under 600, just go for it!",1
